# sightseeings-bulgaria
Demo project. This is a node.js web application, built with express.js, mongoose, passport, Cloudinary, Mapbox and more.

My goal with this project is to learn how to built a web application using node, express and mongoose together. The main functionalities are: 
 - browsing through a list of sightseeings in Bulgaria
 - searching through the list via a search bar
 - looking at the interactive map, where you can find the sightseeings based on their location
 - user authentication 
 - adding new sightseeing
 - editing sightseeing based on authorization
 - deleting a sightseeing based on authorization
 - looking at each individual sightseeing's page
 - writing review on a sightseeing
 - deleting a review based on authorization
 - marking a sightseeing as visited
 - showing how many people have visited a specific sightseeing
 *Note: I had some problems configuring Mapbox in the project. This is why Bulgarian addresses can't be displayed correctly. So keep that in mind when writing the location in the create sightseeing page. I suggest just adding the name of the city in the input field for the address.
 
 The app is deployed with Heroku and I am using Atlas to store my mongo database.
